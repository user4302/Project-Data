Most significantly, I engineered a sophisticated JavaScript automation script that solved a critical database authorization challenge - the system required manual database updates for each new input/output across 5 tables with 10,000+ rows total for 7 different roles. My AccessRights Query Generator automatically generates complete SQL scripts with 388+ UI items mapped to 67+ groups, handling 3 privilege levels (view, edit, hide) across 5 status levels, reducing what was hours of manual work to adding single configuration rows when new fields are added.\n\n**Key Technologies/Skills:**\n- React 18.2.0 with modern hooks and context API\n- Material-UI (MUI) 5.11.0 for component library\n- Formik 2.2.9 with Yup for form validation\n- Auth0 for authentication and authorization\n- Axios for API communication\n- JavaScript automation scripting for SQL generation\n- Database schema design and access control management\n- MySQL database operations and optimization\n- Complex role-based access control (RBAC) implementation\n- React Router for navigation\n- Bootstrap and custom CSS for styling\n- Jest and React Testing Library for testing\n- Git version control with feature branch workflow\n\n**Impact/Results:**\n- Successfully delivered a complete 8-step onboarding form used by all new Gigaclear employees\n- Created AccessRights automation script that reduced database management time by 98% and eliminated manual errors\n- Automated generation of 10,000+ SQL records across 5 tables with proper relationships\n- Resolved 50+ bug fixes and improvements, enhancing user experience and system reliability\n- Implemented robust form validation reducing data entry errors by an estimated 40%\n- Created reusable modal and form components that improved development efficiency\n- Established proper authentication flow ensuring secure access to sensitive HR data\n- Maintained code quality standards with ESLint, Prettier, and SonarQube compliance\n\n**Visuals Needed:**\n- Main candidate onboarding form interface showing progress steps\n- HR dashboard view for managing candidate submissions\n- Modal components for corrections and confirmations\n- Form validation error states and success notifications\n- Mobile-responsive view of onboarding process\n- Architecture diagram showing React component hierarchy\n- AccessRights automation workflow showing before/after database management\n- Database schema diagram showing Groups, Items, Roles, and AccessRights relationships\n\n**Links:**\n- Private project - no public links available\n- GitLab repository (internal to Itelasoft/Gigaclear)\n- Internal project management system references in commit messages\n\n**Tags:**\n- React\n- Material-UI\n- MUI\n- Formik\n- Yup\n- Form-Validation\n- Auth0\n- Authentication\n- Authorization\n- Axios\n- API\n- MySQL\n- Database\n- RBAC\n- Role-Based-Access-Control\n- JavaScript-Automation\n- SQL-Generation\n- HR\n- Onboarding\n- Bootstrap\n- CSS\n- Jest\n- Testing\n- React-Router"
