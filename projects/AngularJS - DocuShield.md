**Project Title:** DocuShield - Secure Document Sharing Platform

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**  
DocuShield is a secure document sharing and editing platform built as a modern Angular web application using Angular 20. Leveraging the latest Angular CLI and standalone components architecture, it offers a responsive foundation with advanced UI/UX patterns tailored for collaborative document workflows, including real-time editing, access controls, and secure sharing features.

**My Role & Contribution:**  
I architected and configured the full Angular 20 project from the ground up, adopting standalone components and cutting-edge development practices. I implemented a robust TypeScript setup, SCSS-based styling, integrated testing frameworks, and ensured mobile-responsive designs. The app features a sleek landing page with CSS variables, gradient effects, and intuitive layouts optimized for document-centric user experiences.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Angular 20 with Standalone Components
- TypeScript 5.8.2
- SCSS/CSS featuring modern variables and gradients
- Jasmine & Karma for comprehensive unit testing
- Angular CLI for scaffolding, builds, and workflows
- Mobile-first responsive design principles
- Optimized production builds with performance budgets

**Impact/Results:**
- Delivered a production-ready Angular 20 foundation for secure document collaboration
- Streamlined modern workflows with automated testing and efficient builds
- Designed a visually striking, responsive landing page using contemporary patterns
- Fine-tuned build configurations for superior performance and bundle optimization
