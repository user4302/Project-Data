**Project Title:** AutoHotkey v2 Productivity Automation Suite

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
This is a comprehensive AutoHotkey v2 automation toolkit designed to enhance Windows productivity through system-wide hotkeys and automated workflows. The project solves repetitive computing tasks by providing modular scripts for power management, application launching, window manipulation, and specialized hardware monitoring automation. It serves as a centralized productivity enhancement system for Windows power users.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I designed and implemented a modular AutoHotkey v2 automation framework with over 15 specialized task modules. I created the main orchestrator script that manages includes and hotkey registrations, developed power management utilities with Windows powercfg integration, built bulk application launchers for 15+ productivity tools, and engineered hardware monitoring automation for HWiNFO sensor logging. I also implemented window management utilities, administrative terminal launchers, and repetitive task automation loops for content creation workflows.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- AutoHotkey v2.0 scripting language
- Windows API integration and window management
- Windows powercfg command-line utilities
- Process automation and control flow
- Hardware monitoring software integration (HWiNFO)
- System administration and elevated privilege handling
- GUI automation and mouse/keyboard scripting
- File system operations and CSV logging

**Impact/Results:**
- Reduced daily application startup time from manual 2-3 minutes to automated 30-second process
- Enabled instant power scheme switching across 5 different performance profiles
- Automated hardware sensor logging workflow that previously required manual intervention
- Streamlined content creation pipeline with automated YouTube upload preparation
- Eliminated repetitive mouse-click sequences through configurable automation loops

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main script execution window showing loaded modules
- Power scheme switching demonstration with performance profiles
- HWiNFO automation workflow screenshot showing sensor logging
- Bulk application launcher in action with multiple apps starting
- YouTube upload automation sequence overview
- Desktop icon toggle demonstration
