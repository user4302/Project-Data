**Project Title:** Git Repository Optimization Suite

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
This project provides a comprehensive suite of shell scripts designed to optimize Git repositories by cleaning up unnecessary data, reducing repository size, and improving performance. The scripts are specifically tailored for automated maintenance workflows, with integration for Minecraft server notifications via tmux sessions.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a collection of specialized Git optimization scripts that handle different levels of repository cleanup. The scripts include aggressive garbage collection, standard pruning, repacking operations, and commit history management. Each script is designed with automated execution in mind, featuring progress notifications and integration with tmux sessions for real-time status updates to users.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Bash/Shell Scripting
- Git version control operations
- Repository optimization and maintenance
- tmux session management
- Linux system administration
- Automated workflow scripting
- File system operations and disk usage monitoring

**Impact/Results:**
- Significantly reduced Git repository storage footprint through aggressive cleanup operations
- Improved repository performance and cloning speeds for large codebases
- Automated maintenance workflows with real-time user notifications
- Provided multiple optimization levels (standard, aggressive, repack) for different use cases
- Enabled safe rollback capabilities with soft reset functionality

**Visuals Needed:**
- Terminal output showing before/after repository sizes
- Script execution flow diagram
- tmux integration demonstration
- Repository size reduction comparison chart
- Command-line interface screenshots
