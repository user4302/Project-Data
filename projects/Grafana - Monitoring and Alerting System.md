**Project Title:** Grafana Monitoring and Alerting System

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
This project implements a comprehensive monitoring and alerting solution using Grafana, Prometheus, and Blackbox Exporter. The system provides real-time visibility into system performance metrics, website availability, and service health monitoring. It enables proactive infrastructure monitoring through customizable dashboards and automated alerting for critical system thresholds.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I designed and implemented a complete monitoring stack including Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and Blackbox Exporter for external service monitoring. I created multiple pre-configured dashboards for system metrics, website monitoring, and transaction tracking, along with alert rules for CPU and memory usage thresholds. I also configured monitoring targets for multiple external websites and set up the complete export pipeline.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Grafana (Dashboarding and Visualization)
- Prometheus (Metrics Collection and Storage)
- Blackbox Exporter (External Service Monitoring)
- Windows Exporter (System Metrics)
- Alert Management and Configuration
- YAML Configuration Management
- JSON Dashboard Configuration
- System Monitoring Best Practices

**Impact/Results:**
- Implemented monitoring for 8 external websites with automated availability checks
- Created real-time system performance dashboards tracking CPU, memory, and disk usage
- Established automated alerting for critical system thresholds (CPU/RAM >80%)
- Provided comprehensive visibility into infrastructure health and performance metrics
- Reduced manual monitoring overhead through automated alerting and visualization

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main Grafana dashboard overview showing system metrics
- Website monitoring dashboard with availability status
- Alert configuration interface screenshots
- Prometheus targets status page
- System performance graphs and charts
- Alert notification examples
