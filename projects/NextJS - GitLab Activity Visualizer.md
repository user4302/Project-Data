**Project Title:** GitLab Activity Visualizer

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
A high-performance, real-time GitLab contribution calendar generator that creates beautiful SVG-based activity visualizations. The application fetches data directly from GitLab's official API and allows users to embed customized contribution calendars in their GitHub READMEs or personal portfolios with multiple theme options.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I designed and built the complete full-stack application from scratch, implementing the core SVG generation algorithm that matches GitLab's official 5-range contribution system (0, 1-9, 10-19, 20-29, 30+). I created the interactive React component with real-time preview functionality, implemented four distinct color themes, optimized the API for serverless deployment with intelligent caching, and ensured seamless deployment on Netlify with proper configuration.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- SVG generation and manipulation
- GitLab API integration
- Serverless functions (Netlify)
- Real-time data fetching and caching
- Responsive UI/UX design

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully deployed live application serving real-time GitLab activity data
- Implemented precise 5-range contribution matching system identical to GitLab's official breakdown
- Created four professional themes (GitLab Light/Dark, Sky Blue, Warm Orange) for user customization
- Built interactive generator with live preview and one-click Markdown embedding
- Achieved high performance with optimized SVG rendering and intelligent caching strategies

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main landing page hero section with gradient background
- Interactive theme selector with color palette previews
- Live calendar preview showing real-time GitLab activity
- Generated SVG calendar output with proper date ranges and legend
- Markdown embed code interface with copy functionality
