**Project Title:** Poké Explorer

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**
A modern Next.js web application that allows users to explore the complete Pokémon database through an intuitive interface. The application features real-time search functionality with debounced input, infinite scrolling for seamless browsing, and detailed Pokémon information pages. It provides an engaging way to discover and learn about different Pokémon species using data from the official PokeAPI.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I built the entire Pokémon Explorer application from scratch, implementing a full-stack React solution with modern web development practices. I created the responsive UI components using Tailwind CSS, implemented infinite scroll functionality with React Query, built a custom debounced search hook, and developed dynamic routing for individual Pokémon detail pages. I also established proper TypeScript type definitions for API responses and ensured accessibility throughout the application.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Next.js 16.0.6 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- TanStack Query for data fetching and caching
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- React hooks and custom hook development
- REST API integration with PokeAPI
- Server-side rendering and client components
- Intersection Observer API for infinite scrolling
- Accessibility (ARIA attributes and semantic HTML)

**Impact/Results:**
- Created a performant web application that handles large datasets efficiently through pagination and caching
- Implemented responsive design that works seamlessly across all device sizes
- Built accessible UI components following WCAG guidelines
- Optimized user experience with debounced search reducing unnecessary API calls
- Developed a scalable component architecture that can be easily extended

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main homepage showing the Pokémon grid layout with search functionality
- Infinite scroll demonstration showing loading states
- Pokémon detail page displaying comprehensive information
- Search interface with real-time filtering results
- Mobile responsive design showcase
- Dark mode implementation examples
