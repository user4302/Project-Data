**Project Title:** Novel Reader App - Ancient Library Edition

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**
A premium web-based novel reader application built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application provides an immersive reading experience with realistic page-flip animations and a distraction-free ancient library aesthetic. It supports bilingual content (English/German), persistent reading progress, and dynamic book loading from a structured content management system.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I designed and built the complete novel reader application from scratch, implementing the core reading interface with react-pageflip animations, creating a responsive sidebar navigation system with table of contents and bookmarks, developing a bilingual content management system with automatic chapter discovery, establishing the ancient library parchment theme with serif typography, implementing persistent state management using Zustand and localStorage, creating a comprehensive test suite with Jest and React Testing Library, and writing detailed documentation including the Adding Books Guide.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- Zustand for state management
- React PageFlip for animations
- React Markdown with remark/rehype plugins
- Jest and React Testing Library
- Responsive design and mobile optimization
- Filesystem-based content management

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully launched a production-ready novel reader with comprehensive feature set
- Implemented bilingual support for German and English content with automatic language detection
- Created an intuitive content management system allowing easy addition of new books without code changes
- Achieved responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile reading experiences
- Established comprehensive test coverage ensuring code reliability and maintainability

**Visuals Needed:**
