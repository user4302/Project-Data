**Project Title:** YC Directory - Startup Pitch Platform

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**
YC Directory is a modern web platform that enables entrepreneurs to submit startup pitches, connect with fellow founders, and gain visibility through virtual competitions. The application provides a searchable directory of startup ideas where users can browse, filter by category, and view detailed pitch information. It features user authentication via GitHub, content management through Sanity CMS, and a responsive interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a full-stack startup directory platform with Next.js 15, implementing server-side rendering, authentication flows, and real-time content management. I created the core components including startup cards, search functionality, and detailed pitch views. I integrated Sanity CMS for content management, set up GitHub OAuth authentication with NextAuth, and designed a modern UI using Tailwind CSS with custom utility classes. The project includes proper TypeScript typing, responsive design, and optimized performance features.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router and Server Components
- Sanity CMS for content management and headless CMS integration
- NextAuth.js for GitHub OAuth authentication
- TypeScript for type safety and development experience
- Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive styling
- React Server Components and Client Components architecture
- Markdown-it for content rendering
- Lucide React for iconography

**Impact/Results:**
- Created a scalable startup directory platform with real-time content updates
- Implemented efficient search and filtering functionality for startup discovery
- Established proper authentication and user management system
- Built responsive design optimized for various screen sizes
- Integrated headless CMS for easy content management by non-technical users

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main homepage showing startup directory with search functionality
- Individual startup pitch detail page with author information
- Sanity Studio content management interface
- Authentication flow (GitHub login)
- Mobile responsive design demonstration
- Search and filtering functionality in action
