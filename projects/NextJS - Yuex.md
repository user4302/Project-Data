**Project Title:** Yuex Website - Builder.io Powered Next.js Application

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
This is a modern Next.js website project that leverages Builder.io for headless content management, enabling dynamic page creation and editing capabilities. The application uses React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling, and includes advanced features like Lottie animations, cookie consent management, and containerized deployment through Docker.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I contributed to this project by implementing critical build fixes and dependency management. Specifically, I resolved build failures that occurred after Lottie animation integration by updating Docker configurations and package dependencies. I also managed version control operations including reverting problematic changes and ensuring stable deployment configurations.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Next.js 14.2.13 with App Router
- Builder.io headless CMS integration
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lottie animations (lottie-react)
- Docker containerization
- Flowbite React components
- Cookie consent management
- Git version control and build troubleshooting

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully resolved build failures that were blocking deployment after Lottie integration
- Maintained project stability through careful dependency management
- Ensured proper Docker configuration for seamless containerized deployment
- Contributed to maintaining the project's modern tech stack and functionality

**Visuals Needed:**
