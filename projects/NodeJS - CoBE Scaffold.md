**Project Title:** CoBE Scaffold - Modular Node.js Infrastructure Template

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
Cobe Scaffold is a production-ready, modular monolithic Node.js backend template designed to accelerate development of new backend services. It provides a comprehensive foundation with dual database support (PostgreSQL and MongoDB), Redis caching, S3-compatible storage, authentication systems, and a complete CI/CD pipeline. The project solves the problem of repeatedly setting up backend infrastructure by offering a standardized, customizable starting point that can be cloned and configured for new projects.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I designed and implemented this complete modular infrastructure template from the ground up, including the Express.js application architecture, dual database integration with Prisma and Mongoose, Redis caching and session management, MinIO S3-compatible storage integration, GitHub OAuth authentication with Passport.js, comprehensive Docker containerization, GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration, extensive testing suite with Jest, security middleware implementation, and detailed documentation. I also created the automated setup scripts and deployment configurations for both development and production environments.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Node.js 20+ with TypeScript 5.0+
- Express.js REST API framework
- PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM) and MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
- Redis for caching and session management
- MinIO S3-compatible object storage
- Docker & Docker Compose containerization
- GitLab CI/CD pipeline automation
- Passport.js authentication with GitHub OAuth
- Jest testing framework with comprehensive coverage
- Security middleware (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting)

**Impact/Results:**
- Provides a complete, production-ready backend foundation that reduces project setup time from weeks to hours
- Includes comprehensive test coverage with 11 test suites covering authentication, API endpoints, and service integration
- Features automated CI/CD pipeline with multi-environment deployment capabilities
- Supports both development and production environments with isolated configurations
- Implements security best practices with rate limiting, input validation, and secure authentication

**Visuals Needed:**
- Architecture diagram showing the modular service structure
- Docker container composition overview
- CI/CD pipeline flow visualization
- API endpoint documentation structure
- Health monitoring dashboard screenshot
- Development vs production environment comparison
