**Project Title:** Hyfen8 Portal Backend API

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
The Hyfen8 Portal Backend is a comprehensive RESTful API built with Node.js and Express that serves as the backend infrastructure for the Hyfen8 portal and website. The system provides authentication, user management, survey submission, and assessment scoring functionality. It processes complex business assessment data, calculates scores across multiple dimensions including knowledge and people metrics, and generates PDF reports with email notifications for clients.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I made significant contributions to the Hyfen8 portal backend as a key developer, implementing critical features and fixes. My work included integrating Sentry error monitoring for enhanced application stability, developing and debugging complex score calculation algorithms for business assessments, implementing email functionality to automatically send reports to clients when they request assessments, and maintaining user profile validation systems. I also contributed to deployment configurations and environment setup improvements.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Node.js & Express.js for REST API development
- MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling and database operations
- JWT authentication and role-based authorization systems
- PDF generation using PDFKit for report creation
- Email services with Nodemailer for client communications
- Sentry integration for error monitoring and tracking
- Complex business logic implementation for assessment scoring algorithms
- Docker containerization for deployment
- Jest testing framework for quality assurance

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully integrated Sentry error monitoring, improving application stability and error tracking capabilities
- Fixed critical bugs in score calculation algorithms that were causing 500 errors in report generation
- Implemented automated email reporting system that sends assessment results directly to clients
- Enhanced user profile management with improved validation and role-based access controls
- Maintained high code quality standards through ESLint, Prettier, and comprehensive testing practices

**Visuals Needed:**
- API documentation dashboard showing available endpoints
- Assessment scoring flow diagram
- Email report generation workflow
- Error monitoring dashboard from Sentry integration
- Database schema overview for user and assessment models
