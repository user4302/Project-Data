**Project Title:** Simple Node.js API Server

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**
A lightweight Node.js Express API server designed for testing purposes. The project provides a basic RESTful endpoint that accepts POST requests and logs incoming data to the console. It serves as a minimal foundation for API development and testing workflows.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I created a minimal Express.js server with a single POST endpoint at `/post` that accepts JSON payloads and returns a success response. The implementation includes proper middleware for JSON parsing and runs on port 3030 with nodemon for development convenience.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Node.js
- Express.js framework
- JSON middleware handling
- RESTful API design
- Nodemon for development
- Basic HTTP server configuration

**Impact/Results:**
- Provides a simple, reliable testing endpoint for API development
- Enables quick prototyping of client-server communication
- Serves as a foundational template for more complex API projects
- Demonstrates clean, minimal Node.js server architecture

**Visuals Needed:**
- Server startup console output showing successful port binding
- API endpoint testing with POST request/response example
- Project directory structure overview
- Package.json dependencies visualization
