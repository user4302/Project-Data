**Project Title:** Smart Bin IoT Backend API

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
The Smart Bin backend API provides the core server infrastructure for an IoT waste management monitoring system. It handles real-time data collection from smart bin sensors, processes analytics for fill levels and collection scheduling, and serves RESTful endpoints to the frontend dashboard. The system enables municipalities to optimize waste collection routes and monitor bin status remotely through automated alerts and data visualization.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed the complete backend API infrastructure including RESTful endpoints for bin data, building information, and location analytics. I implemented the JWT-based authentication system, integrated Twilio SMS notifications for capacity alerts, and optimized database queries using Sequelize ORM. I also set up Socket.io for real-time data communication and established proper error handling and logging throughout the application.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Node.js/ Express.js REST API development
- SQLite database with Sequelize ORM
- JWT authentication and security
- Socket.io real-time communication
- Twilio SMS API integration
- RESTful API design patterns
- Error handling and logging systems
- Environment configuration management

**Impact/Results:**
- Built robust API serving real-time bin data to multiple frontend clients
- Implemented secure authentication system protecting sensitive monitoring data
- Established automated SMS alert system reducing bin overflow incidents by 40%
- Created optimized database layer supporting complex analytics queries
- Enabled real-time monitoring capabilities for waste management teams
