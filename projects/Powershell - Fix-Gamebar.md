**Project Title:** Game Bar Fix - BcastDVR Cleanup Tool

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
A PowerShell utility designed to resolve Xbox Game Bar recording issues by detecting and terminating stuck BcastDVRUserService processes. The tool provides detailed process analysis with professional UI feedback, automatically cleaning problematic background services that interfere with Windows gaming features. It offers a user-friendly solution for common Game Bar recording failures without requiring administrator privileges.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a comprehensive PowerShell script that automates the detection and cleanup of problematic BcastDVRUserService processes. I implemented a professional command-line interface with colored output, spinner animations, and detailed process reporting including PID, CPU usage, memory consumption, and start time. I created multiple installation methods including a one-click installer, PowerShell profile integration, and PATH configuration. I also established proper project documentation with README, changelog, contributing guidelines, and security policy.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- PowerShell 7.2+ scripting and automation
- Windows process management and svchost service handling
- Background job processing for async operations
- Command-line interface design with colored output
- Error handling and exception management
- Git version control and semantic versioning
- Technical documentation and README writing
- Installation script development

**Impact/Results:**
- Provides a reliable fix for Xbox Game Bar recording issues affecting Windows gamers
- Eliminates the need for manual process termination through Task Manager
- Works without administrator privileges, improving accessibility
- Reduces troubleshooting time from manual investigation to automated one-click solution
- Currently at version 1.1.0 with enhanced process detection and professional UI

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main script execution output showing process detection and termination
- Installation process demonstration (one-click installer)
- Before/after comparison of Game Bar recording functionality
- Script directory structure and file organization
- Command-line interface showing colored output and spinner animations
