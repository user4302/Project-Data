**Project Title:** Git Repository Manager (GRM)

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
Git Repository Manager is a PowerShell-based CLI tool designed to streamline the management of multiple Git repositories from a centralized interface. The application provides users with an intuitive menu-driven system to add, organize, sync, and monitor multiple Git repositories, with specialized handling for specific repository types like Syncthing configurations and WiFi profiles. It solves the problem of managing scattered repositories across different locations by offering a unified dashboard for common Git operations and automated workflows.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I designed and implemented a comprehensive PowerShell-based Git repository management system with modular architecture. I created the main application controller with an interactive menu system, developed four separate functional modules for repository operations, Git operations, utility functions, and specialized repository handling. I implemented configuration management using JSON files, comprehensive logging functionality, and automated workflows for specific repository types including Syncthing folder synchronization and WiFi profile backups.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- PowerShell scripting and module development
- Git command-line integration and automation
- JSON configuration management
- Windows filesystem operations and environment variables
- CLI interface design and user interaction
- Modular software architecture
- Error handling and logging systems
- Windows-specific system integration (netsh commands, environment paths)

**Impact/Results:**
- Centralized management of multiple Git repositories through a single interface
- Automated workflows for specialized repository types, reducing manual configuration steps
- Comprehensive logging system for tracking all operations and troubleshooting
- Modular architecture allowing for easy extension and maintenance
- Streamlined Git operations with status checking and batch synchronization capabilities

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main CLI menu interface showing all available options
- Repository listing table display
- Status check output showing repository states
- Configuration file structure examples
- Log file output demonstration
- Sync operation workflow visualization
