**Project Title:** Plex AniSync Automation Script

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**
This project provides an intelligent automation solution for synchronizing Plex media libraries with AniList anime tracking. The PowerShell script monitors Plex streaming activity and automatically triggers the PlexAniSync Python application to update anime watch status, ensuring seamless synchronization between local media consumption and online tracking without interrupting active streaming sessions.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a comprehensive PowerShell automation system that intelligently manages the timing of PlexAniSync executions based on real-time Plex streaming status. The script includes sophisticated logic to prevent interruptions during active streaming, implements file-based state tracking, and provides detailed logging for troubleshooting. I also created the project architecture documentation and established the complete automation workflow.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- PowerShell scripting and automation
- REST API integration (Plex API)
- Python application orchestration
- File system operations and state management
- Windows Task Scheduler integration
- Git version control
- XML configuration for Windows Task Scheduler
- System monitoring and logging

**Impact/Results:**
- Eliminated manual intervention required for anime watch status synchronization
- Prevented streaming interruptions by implementing intelligent pause detection
- Reduced synchronization latency from manual hours to automated minutes
- Improved accuracy of anime tracking across Plex and AniList platforms
- Created a robust, error-resistant automation system with comprehensive logging

**Visuals Needed:**
- PowerShell script execution output showing streaming detection and sync operations
- Architecture diagram from draw.io file showing system components and data flow
- Windows Task Scheduler configuration interface
- Before/after comparison of AniList status updates
- System flowchart demonstrating the decision logic for sync execution
