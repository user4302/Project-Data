**Project Title:** Sort Into Folders of X

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
This PowerShell utility automates file organization by sorting files from a source directory into numbered subfolders based on a specified quantity per folder. The script recursively processes all files in a given directory and distributes them evenly across sequentially numbered folders, making it ideal for managing large collections of files that need to be batched into manageable groups.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a complete PowerShell automation script that provides interactive file organization capabilities. The implementation includes user input validation, recursive file discovery, dynamic folder creation, and efficient file movement operations. I also compiled the script into an executable for easier distribution and use.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- PowerShell scripting
- File system automation
- Recursive directory traversal
- Interactive command-line interface
- Windows file operations
- Script compilation to executable
- Error handling and validation

**Impact/Results:**
- Provides automated file organization that saves significant manual sorting time
- Enables efficient management of large file collections through batching
- Offers a simple, user-friendly command-line interface for non-technical users
- Reduces human error in file organization tasks

**Visuals Needed:**
- Command-line interface demonstration showing user input prompts
- Before/after directory structure showing file organization
- Script execution flow diagram
- Example of numbered folder creation with distributed files
