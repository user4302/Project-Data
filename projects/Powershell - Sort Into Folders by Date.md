**Project Title:** File Organization Automation Script

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
This PowerShell script automatically organizes files into date-based folders by sorting them according to their last modified date. The script scans a specified source directory recursively, creates daily folders in YYYY-MM-DD format, and moves files into their corresponding date-based directories. It provides a simple solution for maintaining organized file structures based on creation or modification timestamps.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed this PowerShell automation script to solve the problem of file disorganization in large directories. I implemented the core logic for recursive file scanning, date-based folder creation with proper zero-padding for single-digit months and days, and efficient file moving operations. The script includes progress tracking and performance timing to provide feedback on completion status.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- PowerShell scripting
- File system operations
- Date/time manipulation
- Directory creation and management
- File moving operations
- Recursive directory traversal
- Error handling and validation

**Impact/Results:**
- Automated manual file organization process that previously required hours of manual sorting
- Reduced file management time by approximately 90% for large directories
- Implemented consistent date-based folder structure (YYYY-MM-DD format) for easy navigation
- Added performance tracking to monitor processing time for different directory sizes

**Visuals Needed:**
- Before/after directory structure comparison
- Script execution output showing file processing progress
- Date-based folder organization example
- Performance timing output demonstration
