**Project Title:** Winget Upgrade Helper (WUH)

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
A powerful PowerShell module that simplifies Windows package management using winget with an intuitive interface and advanced features. The tool provides a modular architecture with user-friendly menu system, batch operations, comprehensive logging, and support for multiple installer types. It streamlines the process of checking for updates, downloading packages, and managing software installations on Windows systems.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I designed and implemented a comprehensive PowerShell-based package management tool that enhances the Windows Package Manager (winget) experience. I created a modular architecture with 26 separate function files organized into logical categories (Logging, Helpers, PackageManagement, Menu), developed an interactive menu system with 11 different options, implemented support for multiple installer types (MSI, EXE, NSIS, Inno Setup, MSIX/APPX, ZIP), and built features like CSV import/export for batch operations, comprehensive logging with rotation, and automatic PowerShell 7 detection and execution.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- PowerShell 7.0+ scripting and automation
- Windows Package Manager (winget) integration
- Modular PowerShell function architecture
- Interactive CLI menu systems
- Package installer type detection and handling
- CSV import/export functionality
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Windows administration and privilege management

**Impact/Results:**
- Simplified package management workflow with a single `wuh` command
- Reduced manual intervention in software updates through batch operations
- Improved system maintenance efficiency with organized package storage
- Enhanced user experience with color-coded console output and progress indicators
- Streamlined offline package management for systems without internet access

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main interactive menu interface showing all 11 options
- Package selection grid with interactive navigation
- Installation progress indicators and status displays
- Directory structure visualization of downloaded packages
- CSV export/import workflow demonstration
- Before/after comparison of package update process
