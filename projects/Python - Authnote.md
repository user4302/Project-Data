**Project Title:** AuthNote - User Authentication Note Management System

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**
AuthNote is a web-based note management application built with Flask that provides user authentication and personalized note storage. The application allows users to create secure accounts, log in, and manage their personal notes with full CRUD operations. It solves the problem of note organization by providing a simple, secure platform where each user's notes are isolated and protected through authentication.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a complete full-stack web application implementing user authentication, database modeling, and note management functionality. I designed and built the Flask application architecture using blueprints for modular organization, implemented SQLAlchemy models for user and note data persistence, created secure password hashing with Werkzeug, and developed responsive frontend templates using Bootstrap. I also integrated Flask-Login for session management and implemented AJAX functionality for dynamic note deletion.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Flask web framework and Blueprint architecture
- SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite database
- Flask-Login for user session management
- Werkzeug security for password hashing
- Bootstrap 4 for responsive UI design
- JavaScript for dynamic frontend interactions
- Jinja2 templating engine
- RESTful API design patterns

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully implemented a secure authentication system with password hashing and session management
- Created a scalable note management system with user data isolation
- Developed responsive web interface compatible across devices
- Established proper database relationships between users and their notes
- Implemented client-side validation and server-side error handling

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main dashboard showing user notes interface
- Login and registration form screenshots
- Database schema diagram showing User-Note relationships
- Application architecture overview
- Note creation and deletion workflow demonstration
