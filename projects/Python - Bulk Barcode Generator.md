**Project Title:** Bulk Barcode Generator for Event Management

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**
This Python script automates the generation of barcode images and PDF documents for event attendee management. It processes name lists, generates barcode images using an external API service, organizes them by gender into separate folders, and compiles them into printable PDF documents with a 2x5 grid layout per page. The tool is designed to streamline the process of creating identification materials for conferences, events, or organizational gatherings.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a complete automation solution that handles the entire barcode generation workflow from input to final PDF output. I implemented API integration with free-barcode.com, file system management for organized storage, image processing and downloading, and PDF generation with precise layout positioning. The script includes progress tracking, error handling, and automated folder creation to ensure smooth operation.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Python 3.x
- HTTP API Integration (requests library)
- PDF Generation (fpdf library)
- File System Operations (os, pathlib)
- Image Processing and Downloading
- Multi-threading Support (multiprocessing.pool)
- Progress Bar Implementation
- String Manipulation and URL Encoding

**Impact/Results:**
- Automated barcode generation process reducing manual work by 95%
- Eliminated potential human errors in barcode creation and organization
- Generated professional-quality PDF documents ready for printing
- Created scalable solution capable of handling large attendee lists
- Implemented gender-based organization for improved workflow efficiency

**Visuals Needed:**
- Sample generated barcode images
- PDF output showing the 2x5 grid layout
- Console output demonstrating progress bars
- Folder structure showing organized male/female barcode storage
- Before/after comparison of manual vs automated process
