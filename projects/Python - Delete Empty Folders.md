**Project Title:** Empty Folder Deleter Utility

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
This is a lightweight Python utility designed to clean up file systems by automatically identifying and removing empty directories. The tool addresses the common problem of accumulated empty folders that can clutter directory structures after file operations or reorganizations. It provides a simple command-line interface for users to specify a root directory and efficiently clean up all empty subdirectories recursively.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed this utility from scratch as a personal productivity tool, creating a concise Python script that implements recursive directory traversal to identify and safely remove empty folders. I also compiled the script into an executable (.exe) for easy distribution and use without requiring Python installation. The implementation focuses on simplicity and effectiveness with minimal code footprint.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Python scripting and file system operations
- OS module for directory traversal and manipulation
- Command-line interface development
- Executable compilation using PyInstaller
- Git version control
- Recursive algorithm implementation

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully created a functional utility that efficiently cleans empty directories
- Reduced manual cleanup time by automating the process of finding and removing empty folders
- Provided a portable executable solution that doesn't require Python dependencies
- Achieved the core functionality in just 12 lines of clean, readable code

**Visuals Needed:**
- Command-line interface showing the folder path input prompt
- Output display showing the empty folders being removed
- Before/after directory structure comparison
- Simple flowchart of the recursive deletion algorithm
