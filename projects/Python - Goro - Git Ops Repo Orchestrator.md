**Project Title:** Goro — Git Ops Repo Orchestrator

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
Goro is a blazing-fast Textual TUI for managing and syncing dozens of Git repositories simultaneously. It provides an intuitive interface for bulk Git operations across multiple repositories, solving the problem of managing complex workspaces with many projects. The tool combines the convenience of a terminal user interface with powerful Git automation capabilities.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I designed and built the complete Goro application from scratch, including the Textual TUI framework, CLI interface, configuration management system, and Git operation automation. I implemented the core repository management features, created responsive UI components with custom CSS styling, developed async Git command execution, and established the project structure with proper packaging and distribution setup.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Textual (Python TUI framework)
- Typer (CLI framework)
- Pydantic (data validation)
- Rich (terminal output formatting)
- Asyncio (concurrent Git operations)
- Git subprocess automation
- Python packaging with Hatch
- CSS styling for terminal UIs

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully launched v0.5.1 with comprehensive repository management capabilities
- Built cross-platform tool supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Implemented efficient bulk Git operations with progress tracking
- Created intuitive keyboard shortcuts and responsive UI design
- Established proper project structure with automated testing and linting

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main TUI interface showing repository grid with status indicators
- CLI command output demonstrating bulk sync operations
- Repository management dialog screenshots
- Configuration file structure overview
- Before/after comparison of repository status updates
