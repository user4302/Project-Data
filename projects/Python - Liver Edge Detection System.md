**Project Title:** Canny Edge Detector Implementation

**Type:** University

**Short Description:**
This project implements a complete Canny edge detection algorithm from scratch for image processing applications. The project provides a Python class-based implementation that performs noise reduction, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, double thresholding, and hysteresis edge tracking. It includes utilities for loading and visualizing grayscale images, with demonstration notebooks showing the edge detection pipeline and additional image alignment tasks.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I implemented the complete CannyEdgeDetector class with all five core algorithmic components: Gaussian smoothing for noise reduction, Sobel filters for gradient computation, non-maximum suppression for edge thinning, dual thresholding for edge classification, and hysteresis tracking for final edge connectivity. I also created supporting utility functions for image loading, RGB to grayscale conversion, and visualization, along with comprehensive Jupyter notebook demonstrations.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Computer Vision algorithms (Canny edge detection)
- Image processing (Gaussian filtering, Sobel operators)
- Scientific computing (convolution operations, gradient calculations)
- Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and visualization
- Object-oriented programming design patterns

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully implemented a complete edge detection pipeline from mathematical principles
- Created reusable, modular code with configurable parameters (sigma, thresholds, kernel sizes)
- Demonstrated practical applications through image alignment and face processing tasks
- Provided educational resource showing step-by-step algorithm implementation

**Visuals Needed:**
- Edge detection results showing original vs processed images
- Algorithm pipeline visualization (gaussian blur → gradients → non-max suppression → thresholding → final edges)
- Jupyter notebook output screenshots showing intermediate processing steps
- Before/after comparisons for image alignment applications
