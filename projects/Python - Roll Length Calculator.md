**Project Title:** Roll Length Calculator

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**
This is a mathematical utility program that calculates the total length of material in a spiral roll configuration. The application computes the cumulative length of concentric circles between an inner and outer perimeter, providing precise measurements for materials wound in a spiral pattern. It serves as a practical tool for calculating roll lengths in manufacturing, printing, or material processing applications.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a concise mathematical algorithm that accurately calculates the total length of spiral-wound materials. I implemented the core logic using Python's math library to handle circular geometry calculations, including radius determination from perimeters and incremental measurements between concentric circles. The program handles user input for inner and outer perimeters along with the total number of circles to provide precise length calculations.
