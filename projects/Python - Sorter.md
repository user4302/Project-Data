**Project Title:** Sorter

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
This is a Python utility that automatically organizes media files into numbered folders containing a specified number of files each. The tool scans a source directory for video files (.mp4 and .mkv formats), sorts them alphabetically, and distributes them into sequentially numbered folders to help users better organize large media collections.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a command-line file organization tool that takes user input for source directory and desired files per folder, then automatically creates numbered folders and moves files accordingly. I also created a basic GUI interface using tkinter to provide a more user-friendly alternative to the command-line version.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Python 3.x
- File system operations (os module)
- Tkinter for GUI development
- Command-line interface design
- File sorting and organization algorithms
- Input validation and error handling

**Impact/Results:**
- Provides automated file organization for large media collections
- Reduces manual effort in sorting and categorizing video files
- Offers both CLI and GUI interfaces for different user preferences
- Implements alphabetical file sorting for consistent organization

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main CLI interface showing file organization process
- GUI interface screenshot with input fields and button
- Example of before/after folder structure
- File organization workflow diagram
