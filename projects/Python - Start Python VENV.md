**Project Title:** Python Virtual Environment Starter

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**
This project provides an automated Python virtual environment management script that detects and activates existing virtual environments or creates new ones when needed. The tool simplifies Python development workflow by handling virtual environment setup and activation in a single command, ensuring developers always work within isolated Python environments.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I converted the original batch script to Python, enhancing the virtual environment management system with improved error handling and cross-platform compatibility. The implementation includes automatic detection of existing virtual environments at a predefined path, creation of new environments when missing, and immediate activation to streamline the development setup process.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Python 3.x
- Virtual Environment Management (venv)
- Subprocess Management
- File System Operations
- Shell Scripting
- Git Version Control
- Windows Batch Script Conversion

**Impact/Results:**
- Streamlined Python development setup by automating virtual environment management
- Reduced manual configuration time from multiple steps to a single command execution
- Improved development workflow consistency across different Python projects
- Enhanced code maintainability by converting from batch to Python

**Visuals Needed:**
- CLI output showing virtual environment detection and activation
- Directory structure diagram showing the PY/venv/Scripts path layout
- Before/after comparison of batch vs Python implementation
- Workflow diagram showing the decision tree for venv creation vs activation
