**Project Title:** XG DM Device Migration Firmware

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
A Python-based device migration firmware system for XG devices that enables communication between Raspberry Pi and NB-IoT modules via UART communication. The system handles device data collection, WebSocket communication, HTTP server posting, and device management with multiprocessing capabilities for real-time device monitoring and control.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I was the primary developer for the XG DM Device Migration firmware, responsible for implementing the complete communication system. I developed the main application with WebSocket communication, HTTP server posting functionality, and UART communication protocols. I created the UartController class with singleton pattern for serial communication, implemented device data handling with structured objects and arrays, added error handling with try-catch blocks, and managed the entire development workflow with 25+ commits. I also set up the Python virtual environment, managed dependencies, and cleaned up the codebase for production readiness.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Python Programming
- UART/Serial Communication
- WebSocket Communication
- HTTP Client/Server Development
- Multiprocessing Programming
- Raspberry Pi Development
- NB-IoT Module Integration
- YAML Configuration Management
- Git Version Control

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully established communication between Raspberry Pi and NB-IoT modules
- Implemented real-time device data collection and server posting
- Created robust error handling and device management system
