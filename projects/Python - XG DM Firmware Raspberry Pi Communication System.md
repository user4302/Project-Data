**Project Title:** XG DM Firmware Raspberry Pi Communication System

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
A Python-based firmware communication system for XG devices running on Raspberry Pi that enables real-time communication between Raspberry Pi and NB-IoT modules via UART communication. The system handles WebSocket messaging, HTTP client requests, and multi-threaded device communication for IoT device management and data collection.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I was the primary developer for this XG DM firmware system, responsible for implementing the complete communication infrastructure. I developed three iterations of the Raspberry Pi and NB-IoT communication system, with the third attempt being the correct implementation. I created the main application with WebSocket communication, HTTP client functionality, and UART communication protocols. I implemented the reader.py module for multi-threaded device communication, formatted the http_client and uart_handler modules, and managed the entire development workflow with 7 commits focusing on bug fixes, code cleanup, and implementation improvements.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Python Programming
- UART/Serial Communication
- WebSocket Communication
- HTTP Client/Server Development
- Multi-threading Programming
- Raspberry Pi Development
- NB-IoT Module Integration
- YAML Configuration Management
- Git Version Control

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully established stable communication between Raspberry Pi and NB-IoT modules
- Implemented multi-threaded device communication with proper queue management
- Created robust WebSocket messaging system for real-time data exchange
- Developed HTTP client for server communication and data posting
- Achieved working implementation after three development iterations
- Established clean codebase with proper formatting and documentation
