**Project Title:** XG VoLTE Test Suite Collection

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
A comprehensive collection of VoLTE (Voice over LTE) test suites for XG cellular modules across different protocol phases (P2, P3, P4) and a starter pack. The test suites cover various scenarios including basic calls, supplementary services, SMS functionality, SRVCC handovers, emergency calls, and IMS registration testing for cellular network validation.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I was the primary developer for multiple VoLTE test packs, creating extensive test scenarios for XG cellular module validation. I developed test scripts for P2 phase covering basic calls, ICS homing, SRVCC functionality, and UT proxy testing. For P3 phase, I created comprehensive test cases including SMS functionality, call forwarding, roaming scenarios, and supplementary services. For P4 phase, I implemented emergency call testing and additional call scenarios. I also contributed to the XG test starter pack with sequential runner functionality and comprehensive test scenario coverage.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Python Programming
- Cellular Network Testing (VoLTE, IMS, LTE)
- XG Module Driver Integration
- Sequential Test Execution
- SMS and Call Testing
- SRVCC Handover Testing
- Emergency Call Testing
- Git Version Control
- Test Automation Frameworks

**Impact/Results:**
- Created comprehensive test coverage for VoLTE functionality across multiple protocol phases
- Developed 100+ individual test scenarios covering various cellular network conditions
- Implemented sequential test execution framework for coordinated multi-device testing
- Established standardized testing methodology for XG cellular module validation
- Provided production-ready test suites for cellular network certification and validation

**Visuals Needed:**
- Test execution workflow diagram
