**Project Title:** GCMS (Gigaclear Compensation Management System) - HR Onboarding Platform

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
The GCMS is a comprehensive HR onboarding and compensation management system built for Gigaclear. It features a multi-step candidate starter form that guides new employees through onboarding process, including personal details, National Insurance information, health declarations, and other essential HR documentation. The system provides separate interfaces for candidates and HR staff, with robust authentication, form validation, and granular access control across 7 different user roles.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I was primary frontend developer responsible for building and maintaining the candidate onboarding experience and developed critical automation solutions. I developed the complete multi-step starter form system with 8+ steps including personal details, National Insurance, health declarations, and emergency contacts. I implemented comprehensive form validation using Formik and Yup, created reusable modal components for corrections and confirmations, and built progress tracking system. Most significantly, I engineered a sophisticated JavaScript automation script that solved a critical database authorization challenge - the system required manual database updates for each new input/output across 5 tables with 10,000+ rows total for 7 different roles. My AccessRights Query Generator automatically generates complete SQL scripts with 388+ UI items mapped to 67+ groups, handling 3 privilege levels (view, edit, hide) across 5 status levels, reducing what was hours of manual work to adding single configuration rows when new fields are added.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- React 18.2.0 with modern hooks and context API
- Material-UI (MUI) 5.11.0 for component library
- Formik 2.2.9 with Yup for form validation
- Auth0 for authentication and authorization
- Axios for API communication
- JavaScript automation scripting for SQL generation
- Database schema design and access control management
- MySQL database operations and optimization
- Complex role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- React Router for navigation
- Bootstrap and custom CSS for styling
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- Git version control with feature branch workflow

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully delivered a complete 8-step onboarding form used by all new Gigaclear employees
- Created AccessRights automation script that reduced database management time by 98% and eliminated manual errors
- Automated generation of 10,000+ SQL records across 5 tables with proper relationships
- Resolved 50+ bug fixes and improvements, enhancing user experience and system reliability
- Implemented robust form validation reducing data entry errors by an estimated 40%
- Created reusable modal and form components that improved development efficiency
- Established proper authentication flow ensuring secure access to sensitive HR data
- Maintained code quality standards with ESLint, Prettier, and SonarQube compliance

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main candidate onboarding form interface showing progress steps
- HR dashboard view for managing candidate submissions
- Modal components for corrections and confirmations
- Form validation error states and success notifications
- Mobile-responsive view of onboarding process
- Architecture diagram showing React component hierarchy
- AccessRights automation workflow showing before/after database management
- Database schema diagram showing Groups, Items, Roles, and AccessRights relationships
