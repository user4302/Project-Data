**Project Title:** BDO Ship Building Tracker

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
A lightweight and responsive web application designed to help Black Desert Online players track their ship building progress. The application provides an intuitive card-based interface for monitoring ship upgrades, material collection, and crafting requirements. It features visual progression tracking, interactive ship trees with connecting lines, and comprehensive data management capabilities including import/export functionality and local storage persistence.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I designed and developed this complete React-based web application from scratch, implementing the entire frontend architecture including the ship tracking system, material management interface, and data persistence layer. I created the TypeScript type definitions, component structure, and state management system, along with implementing features like goal setting, processing requirements tracking, and responsive design. I also established the development workflow with Vite, ESLint configuration, and version management.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite for development and building
- CSS Modules for styling
- Local Storage API for data persistence
- JSON data management and import/export functionality
- Responsive web design principles
- Component-based architecture
- State management with React hooks

**Impact/Results:**
- Streamlined ship building progression tracking for BDO players with an intuitive interface
- Eliminated manual spreadsheet tracking by providing automated progress monitoring
- Enhanced gaming experience through visual feedback and goal-setting capabilities
- Improved data portability with import/export functionality for progress backup
- Achieved responsive design ensuring accessibility across all device types

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main ship list interface showing card-based layout
- Ship details view with progress tracking and material requirements
- Processing popup for material crafting requirements
- Goal ship selection interface
- Mobile responsive layout demonstration
- Progress tracking visual indicators and completion badges
