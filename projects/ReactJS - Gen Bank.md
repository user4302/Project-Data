**Project Title:** GenBank - Modern Banking Landing Page

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**
GenBank is a modern, responsive banking landing page built with React.js and Tailwind CSS. The project showcases a next-generation payment method platform with a sleek, professional design featuring gradient effects, animations, and comprehensive banking service sections. It serves as a marketing website to attract potential customers with its contemporary UI and user experience.

I implemented a component-based architecture with reusable UI components including Hero section, Navbar, Stats, Business features, Billing information, Card deals, Testimonials, Client logos, CTA, and Footer.
