**Project Title:** Hyfen8 Assessment Portal

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
A React-based web application serving as the main user interface for conducting intangible assets assessments. The portal provides authenticated users with assessment tools, progress tracking, score visualization, and account management capabilities, enhanced with comprehensive analytics to understand user behavior and optimize the assessment experience.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a full-featured assessment portal using React with TypeScript, implementing Material-UI components for consistent design, creating assessment workflow management, building score visualization dashboards, and establishing secure API integration. I implemented advanced analytics tracking with Google Analytics 4 and Hotjar, created custom hooks for state change tracking, and built comprehensive event tracking for user interactions throughout the assessment journey.

- React.js with TypeScript for type-safe development
- Material-UI (MUI) for consistent component library
- Google Analytics 4 for assessment funnel and user behavior tracking
- Hotjar for user session recording and heatmap analysis
- React Router DOM for navigation and route management
- React Hook Form for form handling and validation
- Custom analytics hooks for state change tracking
