**Project Title:** Vue.js CRM Contact Management Frontend

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
This is a Vue.js 3 single-page application that provides a user interface for managing CRM contacts. The application features a contact creation form with real-time validation and integrates with a backend API to submit contact data to HubSpot's CRM system. It demonstrates modern frontend development with Vue Router and responsive design principles.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a Vue.js 3 SPA using Vite as the build tool, implementing a contact form component with comprehensive validation. I created proper routing structure with Vue Router and established API communication using Axios. I also developed an alternative vanilla JavaScript HTML version to demonstrate multiple frontend approaches for the same functionality.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- Vue Router for SPA navigation
- Vite for modern build tooling
- Axios for HTTP client requests
- Component-based architecture
- Form validation and error handling
- Responsive CSS styling
- Environment variable configuration

**Impact/Results:**
- Created a modern, reactive user interface for contact management
- Implemented real-time form validation with user-friendly error messages
- Established clean component architecture for scalability
- Provided multiple frontend implementation options for flexibility

**Visuals Needed:**
- Contact form interface screenshot
- Validation error states demonstration
- Component structure diagram
- Vue Router navigation flow
