**Project Title:** Mobitel Smart Parking Management System

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
The Mobitel Smart Parking Management System is a comprehensive parking solution that provides real-time parking lot monitoring, slot allocation, and management capabilities. The system features an interactive SVG-based parking lot visualization, allowing administrators and agents to manage parking spaces efficiently while providing customers with a public view of parking availability and allocated slots.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I was a key frontend developer responsible for implementing the core interactive parking lot visualization and management features. My contributions included developing the interactive and reactive parking lot SVG system with real-time slot status updates, implementing slot color changing functionality to indicate different parking states (available, occupied, under maintenance), creating the public parking lot view interface to separate agent and public user experiences, building the parking slot allocation and highlighting system with visual feedback for customers, implementing database integration for real-time parking availability updates, adding dropdown functionality for selecting and switching between different parking lot configurations, developing the customer slot blinking feature to guide users to their allocated parking spaces, restructuring the Vue.js application architecture by separating agent and public views, and implementing proper code formatting and ESLint standards compliance across the frontend.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Vue.js 2 with Nuxt.js framework
- Vuetify UI component library
- Bootstrap and Bootstrap-Vue
- SVG manipulation and inline loading
- Axios for API integration
- Vuex for state management
- Socket.io for real-time updates
- ESLint for code quality
- Git version control
- RESTful API integration
- Responsive web design

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully delivered an interactive parking management system with real-time visualization
- Improved user experience through intuitive slot allocation and visual guidance systems
- Enhanced system maintainability by implementing proper code structure and separation of concerns
- Enabled multi-user access with distinct interfaces for agents and public users
- Provided scalable architecture supporting multiple parking companies and configurations

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main admin dashboard with parking lot SVG visualization
- Public parking view interface
- Agent parking management interface
- Slot allocation and highlighting demonstration
- Mobile app interface (if available)
- Architecture diagram showing frontend-backend integration
