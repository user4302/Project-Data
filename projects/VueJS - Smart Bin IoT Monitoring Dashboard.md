**Project Title:** Smart Bin IoT Monitoring Dashboard

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
The Smart Bin frontend dashboard provides a comprehensive web interface for monitoring waste management IoT sensors across urban areas. It displays real-time bin fill levels, interactive geographic maps, and data analytics to help optimize collection routes. The system enables waste management teams to make data-driven decisions through intuitive visualizations and automated alerts.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I built the complete frontend monitoring dashboard including the main dashboard with real-time statistics, interactive Google Maps integration with city selection, and extended detailed views for specific locations. I implemented the Vuex state management system, created responsive UI components using Vuetify, and developed data visualizations with ApexCharts. I also handled authentication flows, route protection, and real-time data updates using Socket.io.
