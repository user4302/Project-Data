**Project Title:** Vue Task Tracker

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**
This is a task management application built with Vue 3 that allows users to create, track, and manage daily tasks. The application provides an intuitive interface for adding tasks with reminders, setting due dates, and organizing tasks efficiently. It demonstrates modern Vue.js development practices with component-based architecture and reactive state management.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a complete task tracking application from scratch using Vue 3 and Vite. I implemented the core functionality including task creation, deletion, and reminder toggling with a clean component-based architecture. I designed and built all UI components including forms, task cards, and interactive elements with proper event handling and state management.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Vue 3 with Composition API and Options API
- Vue Router for navigation
- Vite for build tooling and development server
- Component-based architecture
- Event-driven communication between components
- CSS styling with scoped styles
- ESLint for code quality
- JSON Server for potential backend integration

**Impact/Results:**
- Created a fully functional task management system with CRUD operations
- Implemented responsive design with modern UI/UX practices
- Established proper component hierarchy and data flow patterns
- Demonstrated proficiency in Vue.js ecosystem and modern frontend development

**Visuals Needed:**
- Main task tracker interface showing task list and add task form
- Task card component with reminder indicator
- Add task form modal/section
- Component architecture diagram
- Before/after task reminder toggle demonstration
