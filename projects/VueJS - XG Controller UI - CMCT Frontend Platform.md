**Project Title:** XG Controller UI - CMCT Frontend Platform

**Type:** Professional

**Short Description:**
A comprehensive Vue.js/ Nuxt.js frontend application for the Coordinated Multi Channel Testing (CMCT) platform that provides test automation, execution, and management capabilities. The application serves as the primary user interface for managing test environments, projects, executions, and reporting across multiple test channels and automation servers.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I was a key frontend developer for the XG Controller UI, responsible for implementing critical features and bug fixes across the application. I developed tenant management functionality including adding tenant selection dropdowns for environment creation and tenant columns to environment tables. I implemented conditional logo display system for different brands (Sky, Vodafone, SLR) using environment variables, updated authentication system from @nuxtjs/auth v4 to v5, and created project selection functionality with table views and store management. I also fixed numerous UI bugs including tenant name display issues, logo switching problems, and password validation enhancements.
