**Project Title:** Angelo EDZ Portfolio Website

**Type:** Personal

**Short Description:**
This is a personal portfolio website for Angelo EDZ, a Software Engineer. The project serves as an online resume and showcase of technical skills, featuring project demonstrations, experience timeline, and professional background. It provides visitors with a comprehensive view of the developer's capabilities and completed work across multiple technologies and domains.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I developed a complete Vue.js 3 portfolio website from scratch, implementing a modular component architecture with Vuex state management for project data. I created multiple reusable sections including hero animation, project showcase with filtering, experience timeline, skills display, and contact functionality. I integrated Simple Icons for technology stack visualization and implemented responsive design with custom CSS animations and typing effects.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- Vuex 4 for state management
- Vue Router 4 for navigation
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Simple Icons integration
- Vitest for unit testing
- Netlify deployment configuration
- CSS animations and responsive design
- Component-based architecture

**Impact/Results:**
- Successfully deployed a professional portfolio website showcasing 9+ completed projects
- Implemented dynamic project filtering by category (Frontend, Backend, Terminal, Scripting, Mobile)
- Created engaging user experience with typing animations and smooth transitions
- Established scalable codebase with proper testing setup and deployment pipeline
- Built comprehensive personal brand presence with integrated contact and CV download functionality
