**Project Title:** Windows Registry Context Menu Integration for VS Code

**Type:** Open-Source

**Short Description:**
This project provides Windows Registry scripts to add "Open with VS Code" context menu options for directories and folder backgrounds. The solution enables users to quickly open any folder in Visual Studio Code directly from Windows Explorer by right-clicking, improving workflow efficiency for developers who frequently work with code repositories.

**My Role & Contribution:**
I created and configured Windows Registry Editor (.reg) files that modify the Windows Registry to integrate Visual Studio Code into the system context menu. The implementation includes both addition and removal scripts, providing a complete solution for managing this system integration with proper registry key creation and deletion commands.

**Key Technologies/Skills:**
- Windows Registry Editor (.reg files)
- Windows Shell Integration
- Registry Key Management (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT)
- Context Menu Customization
- System Configuration
- Windows Command Line Interface

**Impact/Results:**
- Streamlined developer workflow by enabling one-click folder opening in VS Code
- Reduced time spent navigating through VS Code's file open dialog
- Improved productivity for developers working with multiple project directories
- Provided reversible solution with both installation and removal scripts

**Visuals Needed:**
- Context menu screenshot showing "Open with VS Code" option
- Before/after comparison of Windows Explorer right-click menu
- Registry editor view of created keys
- Project file structure diagram
